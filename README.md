This project is built with Vite and React, delivering a smooth and fast development experience, and styled using Tailwind CSS combined with DaisyUI to provide a sleek, responsive interface. MongoDB powers the backend for managing user data and post content, while JWT-based authentication ensures secure login and access control. Cloudinary is used for optimized image storage and delivery, and Mailtrap helps manage welcome and notification emails efficiently.
